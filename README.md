# ðŸš€ Employee Attrition Prediction Model 

Welcome to my Employee Attrition Prediction Model project repository! Predicting whether employees will stay or leave the company has never been so exciting! 

##  Project Overview

My mission is to predict employee attrition and help organizations retain their valuable talent! By harnessing the power of machine learning, I aim to make employee retention more data-driven and effective.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps uncover hidden insights in the data! Captivating count plots, mesmerizing histograms, and intriguing box plots were used to better understand the data. 

##  Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is the key to a successful model! Outliers were treated with magic , and data was transformed using the Yeo-Johnson method. Categorical features were encoded with labels for the model's delight! 

##  Feature Engineering

Some feature engineering magic was sprinkled to make the model even more powerful!  New features were created and existing ones modified to enhance predictions.

##  Model Development

An army of models was trained to predict employee attrition! From Logistic Regression  to XGBoost , the model lineup is unstoppable!

##  Model Evaluation

The models are as good as they come! They were evaluated using a barrage of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
